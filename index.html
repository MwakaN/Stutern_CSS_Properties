        <h2>My Name is Mwaka</h2>
        <p> I am passionate about the <b>difference</b> that technology brings to the lives of people. 
            Technology has the ability to <b>impact</b> lives at a level and scale that has never been realized in the history of mankind. 
            <i>The idea that something I create can impact someone across the world now, or in the future is what drives my passion for Technology.</i>
            <p>I love how communication between people has become cheaper, easier, and faster than ever before through technology. 
            Texting, video calling, and sending e-mails is so easy. 
            There are so many apps available online to provide these services.
            We have seen and understood the meaning of <b>globalization.</b> 
            Today, the world is on one platform and there are no physical barriers between nations. People are now 'global' citizens.</p>

        <h2>CSS and Why It is Important</h2>
        <p> <i>CSS</i> stands for <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b>
            It is the coding language that gives a website its look and layout. 
            Along with HTML, <i>CSS</i> is fundamental to web design. Without it, websites would still be plain text on white backgrounds.
            <p>
            <i>CSS</i> allows that fonts other than the default for the browser are specified.
It also allows for the color and size of text and links. It also allows for the application of colors to backgrounds.<br>
Webpage elements in boxes are also floated to specific positions on the page
            So in a nutshell <i>CSS</i> is used to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of the content, 
            how to split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.</p>

        <h2>Margins, Paddings and Borders</h2>
        <p> <i>Margins, padding  and borders </i>are essential elements of spacing when it comes to web design. 
            CSS uses what is called the box model to tell web browsers how to display and space different elements on a web page. 
            All websites are made up of a series of boxes that contain these major components:</p>
        <p><b>Padding</b> - The inner space between the content and the border of your box. Padding works only on elements that have borders.
            It has no effect on elements that don't have borders. 
            It creates the space between the border and the content of an element. <br>
            <b> Border </b>- The perimeter of the box. Borders can be invisible or they could be a thick colored line.<br>
            <b>Margin </b>- The outer space (or lack of space) surrounding the box. 
            Margins form the space outside the borders of elements.
            Margins can still affect an element whether or not it has borders.</p>
